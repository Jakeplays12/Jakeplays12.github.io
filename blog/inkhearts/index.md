To migrate your configuration settings to the new modpack version, follow these steps:

---

1. **Locate the Modpack Files**  
   In your modpack list, look for versions labeled with "NEW" and "OLD" tags for easier identification. Right-click on the old modpack version and select **Open Folder**.

   > *Note:* Your file explorer may look different, but the steps remain the same.

2. **Copy Configuration Files**  
   In the folder that opens, select the following files and folders:

   - `Config`
   - `Resourcepacks`
   - `saves`
   - `options.txt`
   - `servers.dat`
   - `servers.dat_old`

3. **Paste into New Modpack**  
   Go back to the modpack list, right-click on the **NEW** version, and open its folder. Paste the files you copied into this new folder.

This will transfer your configuration, saved worlds, and other settings to the new version of the modpack.
