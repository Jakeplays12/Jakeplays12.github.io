<p>Hey! I'm Jake, I am a skilled student with a strong passion for pursuing a career in the I.T field.</p>

<p>I have knowledge in the programming language JavaScript (JS) and I'm learning while working alongside Skade Gaming's Bot Team to create a Discord.js Bot for their server.</p>

<p>As the Media Team Lead, I create content for Skade Gaming's social platforms, and I ensure that all the skaders are safe online. My primary focus lies in producing Minecraft videos, particularly for Skade Gaming's socials. I showcase events, provide updates, and share exciting content through TikTok and YouTube Shorts.</p>
